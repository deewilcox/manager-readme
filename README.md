## What is This?
Welcome to my team! This is a brief introduction to what it's like to work with me and how I view our dynamic on the team. The TL;DR version is this: My job is to remove roadblocks so you can do your best work, every day. We'll have a 1:1 shortly after you join the team so we can go over this and more specifics about our particular team's dynamics so we can figure out how to work best together. 

## Who I am & My Job Here
I am an Engineering Manager. The teams I lead are made up of software engineers dedicated to supporting and improving stability of our systems. Our job is to help address escaped bugs and system inefficiencies. My team also helps analyze the source of common bugs and manual workarounds to help improve the intelligence and efficiency of the system. My teams are also responsible for rapid delivery of items that meet an immediate business need and do not require a full sprint to complete. 

## Personal Principles & Values

### People over process.
Organizations have a tendency to create all kinds of zany process to target point in time problems. Sometimes these processes work great for everyone, and sometimes they don't. 

If you find that you are not aligned with a process, let me know. Let's talk about it and find a way toward alignment.

### Your gift will make a way for you, but only your character will keep you there. 
You are talented and smart, and you've worked really hard to grow your skill set. That's why you're here. 

### We work hard and fast.
We're committed to increasing our skills so we produce smart solutions that lay a foundation for a stable system that supports the business goals. If you need to grow in a particular skillset, let's work together to define a pathway to help you achieve that goal.

### Commit your code daily. 
It's important to push up your code daily in the event that an emergency arises, and someone else needs to pick up your work. Even if your work is just WIP, push it up at regular intervals. 

If you're not contributing, help me understand why. My job is to remove roadblocks so you can be effective. 

### Don't stay stuck. 
If you are stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, ask one of your peers for help. If you and a peer are stuck for more than an hour, ask me, or let's do a team huddle. 

### D.R.I. - Directly Responsible Individual 
If you wrote some code that broke something else, I prefer that you be the person to fix the break and share lessons learned with the team. If you left an exception uncaught and it's filling up our logs, I expect you to fix it. None of us is above triaging a bug, no matter how small it may seem.

## 1:1s
We will meet bi-weekly for 30-60 minutes. I will book an hour, but how we spend our time is up to you.

These meetings are not status updates. The purpose of these meetings is for us to get to know each other, learn how to work well together, and so I can help further you in your career goals as we both work to move SmileDirect forward. 

## Feedback (giving & receiving)
We encourage feedback and are highly responsive to it. Sometimes this means we course-correct mid-stream, and that can be challenging. However, we believe that Better is Better, and we value providing the best possible solutions to our customers.

Sometimes we get out of alignment.

Systems and processes.

Processes and people.

People and systems.

If you see this happening, tell someone. Let's find a way to fix the breakdown.

## How to Interpret My Calendar 
I intentionally make my calendar visible so that the way I spend my time is transparent. There are times when my calendar can look crazy, and it can fill up really fast. But take my word for it - you are my top priority. I'm in a lot of meetings, but most of them can be rescheduled if need be. If you need to talk, book some time on my calendar, or message me on ~Slack~Teams, or stop me in the hallway. Let's find some time.
