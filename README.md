## What is This?
Welcome to Smile Direct. Our mission is to change lives by disrupting the orthodontic industry and making smiles accessible to people who previously didn't have access.

## Who I am & My Job Here
I am the Application Support Manager. I lead a team of software engineers dedicated to improving the quality and stability of our systems. Our job is to help address escaped bugs and prevent feature bugs. My team helps analyze the source of common bugs and manual workarounds to help improve the intelligence and efficiency of the system.

## Personal Principles & Values

### People over process.
Organizations have a tendency to create all kinds of zany process to target point in time problems. Sometimes these processes work great for everyone, and sometimes they don't. 

If you find that you are not aligned with a process, let me know. Let's talk about it and find a way toward alignment.

### Your gift will make a way for you, but only your character will keep you there. 
You are talented and smart, and you've worked really hard to grow your skill set. That's why you're here. 

Smile Direct is on a mission to disrupt the orthodontics industry. This means we work hard and fast. We're committed to increasing our skills so we produce smart solutions that lay a foundation for a stable system that supports the business goals.

I expect everyone to contribute. Commit your code daily. If you're not contributing, help me understand why. My job is to remove roadblocks so you can be effective. 

Don't stay stuck. If you are stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes, as one of your peers for help. If you and a peer are stuck for more than an hour, ask me, or let's do a team huddle. 

## 1:1s
We will meet bi-weekly for 30-60 minutes. I will book an hour, but how we spend our time is up to you.

These meetings are not status updates. The purpose of these meetings is for us to get to know each other, learn how to work well together, and so I can help further you in your career goals as we both work to move SmileDirect forward. 

## Feedback (giving & receiving)
We encourage feedback and are highly responsive to it. Sometimes this means we course-correct mid-stream, and that can be challenging. However, we believe that Better is Better, and we value providing the best possible solutions to our customers.

Sometimes we get out of alignment.

Systems and processes.

Processes and people.

People and systems.

If you see this happening, tell someone. Let's find a way to fix the breakdown.

## How to Interpret My Calendar 
My calendar can look crazy, and it can fill up really fast. Take my word for it - you are my top priority. If you need to talk, book some time on my calendar, or message me on ~Slack~Teams, or stop me in the hallway. Let's find some time.

## Performance 
I measure performance by effort, effectiveness, and cultural fit. I don't believe in surprising people, so if I have critical feedback to provide to you, we'll do that in our morning stand-ups and in our 1:1s. If you haven't received feedback from me, assume we're good. If you have a nudge something is off, ask me. 

## D.R.I. - Directly Responsible Individual 
If you wrote some code that broke something else, I prefer that you be the person to fix the break and share lessons learned with the team. If you left an exception uncaught and it's filling up our logs, I expect you to fix it. None of us is above triaging a bug, no matter how small it may seem.
